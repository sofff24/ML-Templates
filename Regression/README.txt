Tasks:

Relationship between Water Salinity & Temperature:

Explore whether there exists a relationship between water salinity and temperature.
Analyze the correlation between these two variables.
Visualize the relationship using scatter plots or correlation matrices.
Prediction of Water Temperature based on Salinity:

Note on CSV File:
A CSV file is a commonly used format for storing tabular data, where each row represents a data point and each column represents a feature or variable. In this context, the CSV file bottle.csv likely contains rows representing individual measurements or samples, with columns representing different attributes or measurements taken during the CalCOFI program's oceanographic surveys.
